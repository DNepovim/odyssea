Analyze your website traffic with accurate, real-time stats, live views, visitor counts, top stats, IP geolocation, customizable tracking, and more.

== Description ==

WassUp is a Wordpress plugin to analyze your visitors traffic with accurate, real-time stats, lots of detailed chronological information, customizable tracking, live views, visitor and pageview counts, top stats, charts, IP geolocation, map, two aside widgets, and a dashboard widget.

Wassup does in-depth visitor tracking and shows you incredible details about your site's latest hits...more than you can get from almost any other single plugin. It is very useful for SEO and statistics maniacs who want to see accurate, up-to-date stats displayed in a straightforward, easy to understand manner.

The aim of WassUp is the timely knowledge of what your visitors do when they surf your site. It is not intended to show grouped statistics over preset, long-term time periods like visitors per month, pageviews per quarter, and so on (there are many others tools to better gain that, like Google Analytics). WassUp's flexible, easy-to-read views are the best for learning the details about your visitors' latest activities. With it's customizable filters and search capability, you can drill deeply into the data to learn even more about specific visitors, visitor types, etc.

* search by keyword
* expand/collapse informations (with ajax support)
* usage chart (Google!chart)

= IMPORTANT NOTICES =
* Wassup is compatible with Wordpress 4.0+ and PHP 5.2+
* To run Wassup with Wordpress 2.2 - 3.9 or with PHP 4.3 - 5.1, you must install the full copy of Wassup with backward-compatibility feature available at [http://github.com/michelem09/wassup/](http://github.com/michelem09/wassup/)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add WassUp's chart to my admin dashboard? =
Check the box for "Enable widget/small chart in admin dashboard" under WassUp >>Options >>[General Setup] tab.

= How do I display WassUp widgets on my site? =
From the Wordpress widgets panel, drag the "WassUp Online" widget or the "Wassup Top Stats" widget from the list of available widgets on the left into your theme's "Sidebar" or "Footer" area on the right.

= How do I view the real-time visitor geolocation map in WassUp? =
Check the box for "Display a GEO IP Map in spy visitors view" under WassUp >>Options >>[General Setup] and save, then navigate to WassUp >>SPY Visitors panel to see the map.

= The map has vanished and I get a message like: "Oops, something went wrong" or "Google has disabled use of the Maps API for this application". How do I fix this?" =
Try upgrading to the latest version of Wassup, or go to Wassup-Options and click the Reset-to-Default button if you have already upgraded, or sign up for your own Google!Maps API key at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key#key then enter the key under \"Spy Visitors settings\" in Wassup >>Options >>General Settings tab.

= How do I exclude a visitor from being recorded? =
Navigate to WassUp >>Options >>[Filters & Exclusions] tab and enter a visitor's username, IP address, or hostname into the appropriate field and save.

= How do I stop (temporarily) WassUp from recording new visits on my site? =
Uncheck the box for "Enable statistics recording" under WassUp >>Options >>[General Setup] tab.

= My popular web site is hosted on a shared server with restrictive database size limits. How do I prevent WassUp's table from growing too big for my allocated quota? =
Navigate to Wassup >> Options >> [Manage Files & Data] tab and enable the setting for "Auto Delete" of old records and/or check the box to receive an email alert when the table size limit is exceeded.

= WassUp visitor counts are much lower than actual for my website. Why is there a discrepancy and how do I fix it? =
Low visitor count is likely caused by page caching on your website. WassUp is incompatible with static html caching plugins such as WP Supercache, WP Cache, WP Fastest Cache, and Hyper Cache. To fix, uninstall your cache plugin or switch to a different (javascript-based) statistics plugin.

= How do I upgrade WassUp safely when my site has frequent visitors? =
Read the "IMPORTANT safe upgrade instructions" in the [installation section](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wassup/installation/) of this plugin's README.txt file.

= An unspecified error occurred during plugin upgrade. What do I do next? =
Wait a few minutes. Do NOT re-attempt upgrade nor try to activate the plugin again! An activation error with no explanation is probably due to your browser timing out, not an upgrade failure. WassUp continues it's upgrade in the background and will activate automatically when it is done. After a few minutes (5-10) has passed, revisit Wordpress admin "Plugins" panel and verify that Wassup plugin has activated.

= How do I uninstall WassUp cleanly? =
Answer #1: From a single Wordpress site: navigate to Wordpress Plugins panel and deactivate WassUp plugin. Then, on the same page, click the "delete" link below WassUp name. This deletes both data and files permanently.

Answer #2: From Wordpress multisite Network admin panel: navigate to "Plugins" panel and deactivate WassUp plugin. If Wassup is not "network activated", navigate to the main site/parent domain "Plugins" panel and deactivate Wassup plugin there, then return to the Network admin's "Plugins" panel. Click the "delete" link below WassUp name. This deletes both data and files permanently from all subsites in the multisite network.

Answer #3: From a subsite in Wordpress multisite: navigate to WassUp >>Options >>[Uninstall] tab and check the box for "Permanently remove WassUp data and settings" and save. Next, go to the subsite's Plugins panel and deactivate WassUp plugin. This deletes the subsite's data permanently. No files are deleted (not needed).

Answer #4: From a Wordpress 2.x site: navigate to WassUp >>Options >>[Uninstall] tab and check the box for "Permanently remove WassUp data and settings" and save. Next, go to Wordpress "Plugins" panel and deactivate WassUp plugin. This deletes the data permanently. To delete the plugin files from Wordpress 2.x, use an ftp client software on your PC or login to your host server's "cpanel" and use "File Manager" to delete the folder "wassup" from the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory on your host server.
