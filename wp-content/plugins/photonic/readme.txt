Galleries on steroids! A stylish plugin for galleries of your public and private WP, Flickr, Picasa, SmugMug, 500px, Zenfolio & Instagram photos.

== Description ==

Photonic lets you use the WordPress <code>gallery</code> shortcode and super-charges it with a lot of added functionality. It adds support for several new parameters to enhance the content and look-and-feel of your galleries. It supports <a href='http://flickr.com'>Flickr</a> photos, Photosets, Galleries and Collections, along with <a href='https://photos.google.com/'>Picasa / Google</a> photos and albums, <a href='http://smugmug.com'>SmugMug</a> albums and images, <a href='http://500px.com'>500px</a> photos and galleries, <a href='http://zenfolio.com'>Zenfolio</a> photos, Photosets and Groups, and <a href='https://instagram.com'>Instagram</a> photos. You can also enable authentication for your site visitors that will let them see private and protected photos from each provider.

In case you happen to be using a theme or plugin that already overrides the <code>gallery</code> shortcode, Photonic provides you with the option to use your own shortcode for Photonic galleries. This lets your plugins coexist. Bear in mind that if you deactivate Photonic you will have to remove all instances of this custom shortcode, something that is not required if you stick to the <code>gallery</code> shortcode.

Photonic has built-in support for commonly used lightbox scripts such as <a href='http://brutaldesign.github.io/swipebox/'>Swipebox</a>, <a href='https://osvaldas.info/image-lightbox-responsive-touch-friendly'>Image Lightbox</a>, <a href='http://cornel.bopp-art.com/lightcase/'>Lightcase</a>, <a href='https://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/'>Lightgallery</a>, <a href='http://fancybox.net/'>Fancybox</a>, <a href='http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/'>Colorbox</a>, <a href='http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/'>PrettyPhoto</a> and Thickbox. Non-GPL alternatives like <a href='http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/'>Fancybox2</a> and <a href='http://www.stripjs.com'>Strip</a> are supported, provided you install the scripts yourself. With the exception of Thickbox the lightboxes have been adapted to become touch and gesture-friendly. See the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/third-party-lightboxes/'>Lightboxes</a> page for details.

= 500px Support =

Photos and Galleries (a.k.a. Collections, a.k.a. Sets) on <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/500px/'>500px.com are supported in Photonic</a>.

= Zenfolio Support =

*	<a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/zenfolio/photos/'>Photos</a>
*	<a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/zenfolio/photosets/'>PhotoSets (Galleries and Collections)</a>

For demos of Zenfolio support visit the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/zenfolio/'>Zenfolio page</a>. Note that authenticated content in Zenfolio is not currently supported.

= Instagram Support =

Instagram photos <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/instagram/'>are supported in Photonic</a>. You can display your own feed, and photos based on tags, and location-based searches. Note that while code has been written to support tags and locations, Instagram hasn't approved Photonic's access to others' photos. This means that currently only displaying one's own feed will work.

= Enhanced Native Galleries =
Your existing gallery insertions are left intact. However you can add a <code>style</code> parameter to a native gallery to open it up to Photonic. The <code>style</code> parameter can take any of the values documented on the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/layouts/'>Layouts</a> page.

= Deep-Linking and Social Sharing =

Photonic provides deep-linking support for non-WP images, and by extension, supports social sharing to Facebook, Twitter and Google+.

= Beautiful Layouts =

Photonic displays your galleries either as a grid of square thumbnails (the default), or circular thumbnails (like Jetpack), or random tiles in a justified grid, or a masonry layout, or a random mosaic (a variant of the Jetpack Tiled Gallery layout), or a slideshow. See the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/layouts/'>Layouts</a> page for details.

== Installation ==

You can install the plugin through the WordPress installer under <strong>Plugins &rarr; Add New</strong> by searching for it, or by uploading the file downloaded from here. Alternatively you can download the file from here, unzip it and move the unzipped contents to the <code>wp-content/plugins</code> folder of your WordPress installation. You will then be able to activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I disable the plugin what happens to the galleries? =

Obviously, your galleries will not show. However, since you are using the native <code>gallery</code> shortcode, you will not see any empty shortcode tags on your site.

= When I click on a gallery in the Visual Editor nothing happens. Is the plugin working? =

Yes, the plugin is working. Unfortunately the integration of Photonic with the visual editor is complex, and there is a likelihood of conflicts with other TinyMCE-specific plugins. If you come across such a conflict, please report it on the support forum. In the meanwhile you should still be able to edit the gallery shortcode directly through the text editor.

= My gallery layout seems to get messed up with random text showing up at various places. Are you sure the plugin is working? =

Yes, the plugin is working. The issue you are facing is that you have another plugin (typically some sort of a lightbox plugin) that is modifying the markup generated by Photonic.

Of course, it would be easiest if you were to disable that plugin. If a lightbox is all you need, Photonic's lightbox can be used to display regular photos as well, from your admin dashboard under <em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; Generic Options &rarr; Generic Settings &rarr; Photonic Lightbox for non-Photonic Images</em>. This will ensure consistency across Photonic and non-Photonic images.

However, if you really wanted to keep that plugin, Photonic offers a way out there too! For each provider (e.g. Flickr, Picasa etc.) go to the Settings page, e.g. <em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; SmugMug &rarr; SmugMug Settings &rarr; Disable lightbox linking</em> and set that option.

= I upgraded, and now my SmugMug galleries won't show. Are you really sure the plugin is working? =

Yes, the plugin is working. Here is what happened: version 1.57 of Photonic moved from API v1.3 of SmugMug to API v2. Your API keys probably were created for v1.3 and need to be authorized for v2. See <a href='https://aquoid.com/2016/12/smugmug-access-in-photonic-1-57/'>here</a> for instructions.

= The plugin says it supports Picasa. Does it support Google Photos? =

Yes. Google Photos <a href='https://developers.google.com/google-apps/products'>doesn't have a public API</a>, and the <a href='https://developers.google.com/picasa-web/docs/2.0/reference'>old Picasa API remains</a>. Google disbanded PicasaWeb in a giant leap backwards, by making it harder to find album IDs (resolved in Photonic through <em>Photonic &rarr; Helpers &rarr; Picasa / Google Photos</em>), completely eliminating the <code>authkey</code> capability of PicasaWeb (older Picasa albums with <code>authkey</code> still work), allowing the use of protected albums only for fully authenticated users (supported in Photonic through authentication), and making it almost impossible to make an album public (third-party workarounds exist, as documented <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/picasa/picasa-albums/'>here</a>).

However, to get around all these impositions, Photonic allows you "Back-End", or "Server-Side" authentication for Google Photos. Using this, displaying your content becomes a lot easier. See the <a href='https://aquoid.com/plugins/photonic/picasa/picasa-albums/'>documentation page</a> for instructions.

= What about other photo-sharing platforms? =

Suggestions are welcome for other photo-sharing platforms.

= What about other JS libraries? =

Currently Swipebox, Image Lightbox, Lightcase, Lightgallery, Fancybox, Colorbox and PrettyPhoto are supported. Inbuilt support is also present for the non-GPL Fancybox2 and Strip. Both lighter and heavier alternatives are being considered. If you have specific suggestions please feel free to contact the plugin author.

Note that there have been slight modifications to some of the above scripts to make them interact seamlessly with JQuery tooltips.

= Are there any known issues? =

Authentication in Zenfolio is not supported (but password-protection is). And, as explained in the "Description", the Instagram API has been coded to support hashtags and locations, but Instagram itself has not provided Photonic access to those features.

Also, the TinyMCE integration for the plugin is complex, predominantly since Photonic doesn't rely on a separate shortcode. This can cause potential conflicts with other plugins. If such a situation arises, please report it in the <a href='https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/photonic/'>Support Forum</a>, and disable the visual editor capability for the shortcode (<em>Photonic &rarr; Settings &rarr; Generic Options &rarr; Generic Settings &rarr; Disable shortcode editing in Visual Editor</em>) - you will still be able to edit the shortcode using the Text Editor in WordPress.

The "Mosaic" layout may sometimes show 1px wide gaps betweeen images, if you set the padding between images to 0. This happens due to rounding errors in the height and width calculations. To avoid this, it is recommended that you use a padding &gt; 0 between images for this layout.

Apart from these, while the plugin can handle pretty much whatever you throw at it, Lubarsky's Law of Cybernetic Entomology states:
<blockquote>There is always one more bug.</blockquote>

Bug reports are welcome, and handled enthusiastically.

= Are translations supported? =

Yes, but only for the plugin front-end. The admin panel is not translated at this point. Also note that any strings included in the third-party JS scripts are not translated.
