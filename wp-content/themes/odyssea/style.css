v1.5	Fixed some issues with this theme working on 2.8. Fixed the threaded comments so that they would show trackbacks and also changed the styling on the comments drop down to something a little more user friendly. (JRW)
v1.3  	Added threaded comments, footer links (David Coveney)
v1.2.2 	Fixed a slight problem with Safari that I created for myself. Doh! I blame the buggy hell spawn that was safari v3 under windows. v4 seems better at matching the Mac version. (JRW)
v1.2.1 	Fixed search widget under 2.6.(JRW)
		Added caption support.
